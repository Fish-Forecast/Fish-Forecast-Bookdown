## Further Reading

This chapter covers a small sample of the simpler ETS models that can be fit. There are many other types of more complex ETS models and the `ets()` function will fit these also.  Rob J Hyndman (lead on the forecast package)  and George Athanasopoulos have an excellent online text on practical forecasting and exponential smoothing. Read [their chapter](https://otexts.org/fpp2/expsmooth.html) on exponential smoothing to learn more about these models and how to use them.

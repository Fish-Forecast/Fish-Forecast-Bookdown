## Packages

We will be using the forecast and tseries packages, with the MARSS package to implement ARMAX models.  However we will also use a variety of other packages.  So that you can keep track of what package a function come from, I will use the `::` notation for functions that are not from the following standard packages:

* base R
* stats
* ggplot2

Thus to call function fun1 from package pack1, I will use `pack1::fun1()`.  This will make the code a bit more verbose but you will be able to keep track to what function comes from what package.

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

* ggplot2
* gridExtra
* grid
* forecast
* tseries
* urca

#### tidyverse and piping {-}

Also I will minimize the use of tidyverse and piping.  Although the latter can create much more concise code, for beginner R users and programmers, I think it will interfere with learning.  I may add the piped versions of the code later.  I am not going to be doing much 'data-wrangling'.  I will assume that your data are in the tidyverse format, though I will not be using tibbles explicitly.  Our data are quite simple, so this is not hard.  See the chapter on inputting your data. 

#### plotting packages {-}

I will use a combination of base plotting and ggplot2 plotting.  Doing a tutorial on basic plotting with ggplot2 may be helpful for the material.

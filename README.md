# Forecasting Webpage

This is based on Mark's slide templates (present) for presentations written in R Markdown using **[xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)**, an R package for creating slideshows with **[remark.js](http://remarkjs.com)**.

Put external (meaning not produced by R within the Rmarkdown file) figures and pictures in directory 'figs'.

The internally made figures will be put automatically in 'template_files/figure-html'.

See template.Rmd for examples of formatting slides.

Click 'knit' in RStudio to create the html file.  To print to pdf, use Chrome.
